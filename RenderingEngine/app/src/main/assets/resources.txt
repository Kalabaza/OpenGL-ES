# 
# Resources used on the rendering engine
# 
# Atributes have 3 properties: Name, Length, Buffertype
# Name:		String to get the attribute from the shader
# Length:	Can be 2, 3 or 4 (vec2, vec3 and vec4)
# Buffertype:	Where the data is comming from?
#		0 - Vertices
#		1 - Textures
#		2 - Normals
# 
# Uniforms have 1 property: Name
# Name:		String to get the uniform from the shader
# 
# Projection matrix is handle in a special way on each object as well as the 
# Modelview matrix, the uniforms use a different format.
# 
# The coordinates of an object are sent using three vertices and a angle
# (group of also three float values): Position, Scale, Rotation and Angle
# 
# Each object has its own vertex and fragment shader and also the texture
# that is used during rendering.
# 
# The texture needs to provide the file name and in the case of the skymap
# all the faces need to be provided.
# 
# The object definition starts with a point and ends with a dash (. -)
